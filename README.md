Working example code for using four channel relay board with Raspberry Pi 4B

2019/09/22 Douglas Goodall (dwg) - 

This repository contains what might be the last release of wiringPi
written by Gordon Henderson. It supports the Raspberry Pi 4B and 
previous versions. I run this code using the latest version of
Raspbian Linux. This repository is an unofficial location and the
conanical location is https://wiringpi.com.

I made minor corrections to the relay.c program such as including 
the unistd.h and a typo in a define. Otherwise it is as provided
by Gordon, and much appreciated.
